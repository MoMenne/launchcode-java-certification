What is a method override?
When a subclass implements the same method signature as a method in one its superclasses
typically denoted with @Override

What is a method overload?
When a class uses the same name of an existing method on that object (in the same class or on a superclass)

What are three facts to know about handling exceptions?
1)  only checked exceptions (of class extending Exception) require handling
2)  handling can be done via a throws in the method signature or a try catch block
3)  you can catch your subclasses of your exceptions as long as the most specific subclassed exception is first
